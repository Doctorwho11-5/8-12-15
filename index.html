<h4>
This is the final page of my HTML Tutorial.
You can look up more techniques for HTML and add in some CSS, Java, Javascript, Bootstrap and more. You can add 
in whatever you desire. But in this Page you will learn shortcuts and the best way to host a website.</h4>
<h2>&ltpre&gt; Tag</h2>
<h4>
&ltpre&gt; the "pre" tag. This tag is used for typing things almost EXACTLY how you want them. Whatever you type 
on the Notepad, it will type on the webpage. I am using pre right now. Every space, new line, and punctuation 
mark will record how you type it.Although it will change a little bit to fit the page size. </h4>
<h2>&ltbr&gt; Tag</h2>
<h4>
&ltbr&gt; the "br" tage. This tag is used for making a "line break"
Used<br>like<br>this.<br> The previous sentence and this sentence are in the same code line, but it appears to be in several lines because
of the "br" tag. If you don't want to type a lot of br tags, the &ltpre&gt; tag is the one you want.
The &l t<i>word</i>&g t; tag is a tag used for making &lt and &gt; tags without making the computer thin it's code. How you 
use it is you put a word inbetween the & lt and & gt; tags to make the symbols. I have been using this throughout 
the entire project. Now the tag doesn't actually have spaces inbetween the & lt, but there isn't a code I know
that allows there to not be a space so, just make your & lt  & gt; tags without a space between the  & and lt/gt; tags.
</h4>
<h2>Hosting</h2>
<h4>
Now as for hosting, you can pay HostGator for 1 penny a month until the price goes up and OH NO! it's $50 now. 
Now you don't have money. OR, you can host it for FREE like me on <a href="https://Github.com">github.com</a>.
Now this takes some time to figure out and you may get seriously frustrated, but eventually, it turns 
out BEAUTIFUL. Now you still want to use the same thing I told you before, where you do it on 
notepad. But then you want to copy and paste the notepad codes INTO your website code section.
<h4>
First sign up for Github.com, then click the cat icon in the upper left when you're done reading the tutorial. 
Then, click "new repository" and name it with whatever you like, except it has to be http://<i>username</i>.github.io
Where <i>username</i> is whatever you want it to be, you just can't use certain punctuations. 
Now, create the repository and make a README file. A README is just a document to inform people about the webpage.
once you're done, make a new file called index.html by clicking the '+' button next to your repository name. copy and paste
your file into the index.html file and click "commit new file". Then, you can go to http://<i>username</i>.github.io
and you're webpage is done! 
You can always edit your webpage and fine new codes to make your website amazing.
Now go make yourself a website.
